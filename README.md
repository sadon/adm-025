# How to start:

1. Review exercise's description in the original presentation (pdf).
It looks like: ![](_docs/providers_states.png)
2. **Start each exercise from empty directory**, you shouldn't use hints (files) in exercise's folder.
3. Use exercise`s README.md file **only** if you have no idea how to complete steps.
4. Each Readme consist steps to complete from A to Z, ex: [./providers/README.md](./providers/README.md). (Default AWS profile named `tf-training` to avoid working with other pre-setup AWS infrastructure)
5. Each exercise folder consist final working version, check this after completing the exercises yourself.
6. Remove resources after completing exercises.
